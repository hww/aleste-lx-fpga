# Aleste XL FPGA

A modern FPGA implementation of the classic Aleste computer architecture.

This project represents an ongoing effort to recreate and reimagine the Aleste system using contemporary FPGA technology. While development continues, there is no guarantee of final completion - it remains an experimental platform for exploring these classic computing concepts.

Key aspects:

- Faithful recreation of the original Aleste architecture
- Modern FPGA implementation
- Experimental nature (may not reach full completion)
- Platform for technical exploration

The project serves primarily as:

- A technical proof-of-concept
- An educational platform for retro computing
- A testbed for architectural experimentation

Note: This remains a work in progress with no definitive completion timeline.
